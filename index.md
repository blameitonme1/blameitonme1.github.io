This is a website for a quick introduction of myself :) Contact me via zhongyibo@stu.scu.edu.cn or yibozhong657@gmail.com

I'm an undergraduate at Sichuan University majoring in Computer Science and now I'm in my second year. I currently have had one researching experience starting from the middle of last semister. I mainly focus on computer vision and model compression. I believe studying efficient model design can enable us to keep studying Deep Learning even when we don't have much computational resources. I have completed the first draft of my paper and am now preparing to submit it for publication.

Many applications nowadays are using large models such as GPT. But in many cases when the task given is small with few samples or the resources are limited, using an extreamely large model is either impractical or unnecessary. More efficient models can tackle this and when they scale up, it may bring even better performance.

My future research interests are improving models in various aspects whether in CV or NLP (I'm not quite familiar with NLP right now ðŸ˜‚).
