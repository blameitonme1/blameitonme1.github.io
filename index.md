Hi there! My name is Yibo Zhong and this is a website for a quick introduction of myself :). Please contact me via zhongyibo@stu.scu.edu.cn or yibozhong657@gmail.com  

# Me
I'm now an undergraduate at Sichuan University majoring in Computer Science and now I'm in my second year. I mainly focus on computer vision and model compression. I'm looking for an intern position in 2025 summer, contact me if you're interested! 

# Research

- One paper in [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08894). It's about the very first project I have done about Parameter Efficient Transfer Learning (or Fine-tuning if you like) in computer vision.
- Two more papers will recently be released.

# Interests
- Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning
- Ai4health (maybe)
