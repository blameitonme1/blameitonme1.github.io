Hi there! My name is Yibo Zhong and this is a website for a quick introduction of myself :) Please contact me via zhongyibo@stu.scu.edu.cn or yibozhong657@gmail.com  

![[Me]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blameitonme1/blameitonme1.github.io/main/me.png)  

I'm an undergraduate at Sichuan University majoring in Computer Science and now I'm in my second year. I currently have had one researching experience starting from the middle of last semister. I mainly focus on computer vision and model compression. I believe studying efficient model design can enable us to keep studying Deep Learning even when we have limited computational resources.

My future research interests are improving machine learning models in various aspects.
